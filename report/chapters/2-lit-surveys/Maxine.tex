\section{NVIDIA Maxine}

We have added NIVIDA MAXINE as a literature survey to share that we are aware of 
a similar service offering video conferencing services using AI. We take 
inspiration from NVIDIA's technology and attempt to overcome their disadvantages.

NVIDIA Maxine is a fully accelerated platform SDK for developers of video 
conferencing services to build and deploy AI-powered features that use state-of-the-art 
models in their cloud. Video conferencing applications based on Maxine can reduce video 
bandwidth usage down to one-tenth of H.264 using AI video compression, dramatically reducing costs.

Maxine includes APIs for the latest innovations from NVIDIA research such as face alignment, 
gaze correction, face re-lighting and real time translation in addition to capabilities such 
as super-resolution, noise removal, closed captioning and virtual assistants. These capabilities are 
fully accelerated on NVIDIA GPUs to run in real time video streaming applications in the cloud.

Maxine-based applications let service providers offer the same features to every user on any device,
including computers, tablets, and phones. Applications built with Maxine can easily be deployed as 
microservices that scale to hundreds of thousands of streams in a Kubernetes environment.~\cite{Maxine}

\subsection{Features}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Easy to use SDK}: Includes libraries, tools and example pipelines 
    for developers to quickly add AI features to their applications.
    \item \textbf{Ultra-low Bandwidth}: AI Video Compression uses one-tenth the 
    bandwidth of H.264 video compression standard.
    \item \textbf{State-of-the-art AI model}: Includes pre-trained models with thousands of hours 
    of training on NVIDIA DGX\texttrademark A100.
    \item \textbf{Fully GPU Accelerated}: Optimizes end-to-end pipelines for the highest performance 
    on NVIDIA Tensor Cores GPUs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Technologies}

\subsubsection{Reduce Video Bandwidth compared to H.264}
With AI-based video compression technology running on \textbf{NVIDIA GPUs}, 
developers can reduce bandwidth use down to one-tenth of the bandwidth needed 
for the H.264 video compression standard. This cuts costs for providers and 
delivers a smoother video conferencing experience for end users, who can enjoy 
more AI-powered services while streaming less data on their computers, tablets, and phones.

\subsubsection{Face Re-Animation}
Using new AI research, you can identify key facial points of each person on a video call 
and then use these points with a still image to reanimate a person’s face on the other side 
of the call using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

These key points can be used for face alignment, where faces are rotated so that
people appear to be facing each other during a call, as well as gaze correction 
to help simulate eye contact, even if a person’s camera isn’t aligned with their screen.

Developers can also add features that allow call participants to choose their
own avatars that are realistically animated in real time by their voice and emotional tone.

\subsubsection{Video and Audio Effects}
AI-based super-resolution and artifact reduction can convert lower resolutions to higher
resolution videos in real time which helps to lower the bandwidth requirements for video 
conference providers, as well as improves the call experience for users with lower bandwidth. 
Developers can add features to filter out common background noise and frame the camera on a user’s 
face for a more personal and engaging conversation.

Additional AI models can help remove noise from low-light conditions creating a more appealing picture.

\subsubsection{Conversational AI}
Maxine-based applications can use NVIDIA Jarvis, a fully accelerated conversational
AI framework with state-of-the-art models optimized for real time performance. Using Jarvis, 
developers can integrate virtual assistants to take notes, set action items, and answer questions 
in human-like voices.

Additional conversational AI services such as translations, closed captioning and transcriptions help 
ensure everyone can understand what’s being discussed on the call.

\subsection{Disadvantages}

NVIDIA Maxine needs all of its devices to have NVIDIA hardware or access to the NVIDIA cloud. 
This reduces the customer base because of its cost and huge unavailability of GPUs.

It is therefore important to understand that dependence on compute-intensive hardware could
currently be our only barrier to building effective applications using Neural Networks.
