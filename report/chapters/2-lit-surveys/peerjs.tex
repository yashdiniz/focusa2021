\subsection{PeerJS}

The PeerJS library is aimed to simplify the peer-to-peer connection management. 
PeerJS wraps the browser's WebRTC implementation to provide a complete, configurable, 
and easy-to-use peer-to-peer connection API. 
With PeerJS, peers are identified by simply using an ID, a string that the peer 
can choose itself, or have a server generate one. 
Equipped with an ID, a peer can create a P2P data or media stream connection to a remote peer.~\cite{PeerJSsimplifiesWebRTC}

\subsubsection{PeerJS Server}

Although WebRTC promises peer-to-peer communication, a server is still required to 
act as a connection broker, and handle signalling.

PeerJS provides an open source implementation of this connection broker 
server named PeerJS Server, written in Node.js.Users can run their own Server, 
or are at leisure to opt for the cloud-hosted version of PeerServer provided for free.
To broker connections, PeerJS connects to a PeerServer. The PeerJS Server acts ONLY as 
a connection broker, and it has to be noted that no peer-to-peer data goes through the server.~\cite{TamingWebRTCwithPeerJS}

To make the P2P connection work seamlessly, we build a neural network encoder and 
integrate it into WebRTC possibly using the P2P library.
