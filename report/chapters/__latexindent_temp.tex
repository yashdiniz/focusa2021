\chapter{Implementation}

% Just added a stub.
% TODO: Complete and fill up the implementation chapter!

% Include experiments and observations from the neural network experiment.
% Also include the process of creating microservices: 1. CRUD. 2. REST. 3. GraphQL.
% Also include the methods of test cases performed.
% Also include the Kubernetes and other deployment stuff.
% Talk about how we are implementing the couchDB distributed DBs.


\section{Overview of the Technologies used}

\subsection{Backend Technologies}

    \subsubsection{PouchDB}
PouchDB is an open-source JavaScript database inspired by Apache CouchDB 
that is designed to run well within the browser.
It enables applications to store data locally while offline, 
then synchronize it with CouchDB and compatible servers when the application is back online, keeping the user's data in sync 
no matter where they next login.

    \subsubsection{RxDB}
RxDB (short for Reactive Database) is a NoSQL-database for JavaScript Applications like Websites, 
hybrid Apps, Electron-Apps, Progressive Web Apps and NodeJs. Reactive means that you can not only 
query the current state, but subscribe to all state changes like the result of a query or even a 
single field of a document. This is great for UI-based realtime applications in way that makes it 
easy to develop and also has great performance benefits. To replicate data between your clients and server,
 RxDB provides modules for realtime replication with any CouchDB compliant endpoint and also with custom GraphQL endpoints. 

    \subsubsection{NodeJS}
