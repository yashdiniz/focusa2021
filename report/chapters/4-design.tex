The user logs in to the app by putting in the valid credentials.
The credentials put in by the user are validated by the system through the authentication mechanism on the server.
If the credentials are found to be incorrect, the system runs the error handler to address the error occurred.
If the user still is not able to produce the correct credentials, the process ends and the user is not allowed to use the app.

If the user has been validated and is found to be genuine, is directed to the home/main page of the app where he can choose to request for the News Feed, User Profile, Courses or launch video conferencing.
All these requests can be made through the navigation panel provided in the app and are accessed as parallel activities.

Once the user requests for a service, the request is sent to the system as a query which is then resolved by the graphQL to extract the specific requested data from the backend and the response returned is then displayed to the user in structured format.

If the user requests to launch the video conferencing, the system estblishes a peer to peer connection with the requested user system, asks the user to grant access to the camera and audio and starts transfering bi-directional vectors as the secure connection is established.
These bi-directional vectors are worked upon by the algorithm used to reduce the bandwidth usage and the output is displayed in the form of video.

If the user decides to log out of the app, it can be accomplished via the corresponding UI component and as a result all the parallel activities combine to close and the user is logged out of the app safely .
The user is also logged out of the app the session times out.
