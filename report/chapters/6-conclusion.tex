\chapter{\centering Conclusion}

% Just added a stub.

% Include a brief discussion and also future scope.

\section{Discussion}
Distributed databases like CouchDB operate with eventual consistency. The CAP theorem proves beyond doubt that it is close to impossible 
to actually achieve consistency, availability and partition tolerance simultaneously, unless we manage to build successful quantum communication.
% TODO
Loose coupling mandates isolation between microservices, thus containerization. Using couchDB for distributed databases ensures the best horizontal scaling.
Cross-platform frontend building tools like React Native are better than directly using ReactJS, since React Native also supports web.
GANs are effectively better at generative tasks than encoding tasks, as the name implies.

\section{Conclusion}

% implemented offline first for a Learning Management System.
% Reduced dependence on a reliable, high bandwidth internet connection.
% Also built a PoC using neural networks as a video conferencing codec.
% Notification service used a distributed communication protocol, implemented in libp2p PubSub, communicating with protobuf.

\section{Future Scope}

% distillation of FOMM neural network
% integrate distilled NN codec with Jitsi
% build a better RPC implementation using entirely libp2p, possibly serverless, and improve integration with GraphQL server.
% Furthermore, completely improve data transfer implementation by using protocols like protobuf and HTTP/3(QUIC)
