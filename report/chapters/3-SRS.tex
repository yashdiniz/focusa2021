\chapter{Software Requirement Specification}

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}

Colleges, schools and other educational environments have a lot of existing tools 
which help students and teachers interact and share resources.
These tools however are developed to serve very specific and limited purposes, and are very difficult to 
manage manually. They fail to provide a single comprehensive platform for all 
necessary management operations. Moreover, these existing tools fail to cater to the 
management and analysis of data and thus are not used for generating useful 
insights.

\subsection{Project Overview}

Our project aims to deliver a scalable web services framework which is easy to work 
with for both the developer and the customers. It will allow connecting students and 
teachers through subscription portals, by letting faculty moderators post content 
which can be accessed by the students and synced whenever an internet connection 
is available. Furthermore, we aim to build a real-time video conferencing platform 
using a lossy compression algorithm involving neural networks. Finally, we plan on 
integrating various existing services like Google Calendar and Drive, to ease 
automation efforts, reducing the need to manually manage multiple tools.

\subsection{Hardware Requirements}

Development:
Minimum 8 GB RAM for native app development
Production:
As stated in the constraints the server should have at least 1 GB RAM  
The client should be able to run the minimal version of the neural network encoder 
(requirements will be obtained through experimentation)

\subsection{Software Requirements}

\textbf{Recommended}
Linux OS 4.19 kernel or later in production, Windows 10 1803 (Build 17134 or later) for development.
NGINX server 1.17 or later as reverse proxy and load balancer.
(add client part also -- client to client)

\subsection{Constraints}

Needs to run in ~1GB, with 1 vCPU core at production environment
Clients will have limited network bandwidth, mostly using mobile web browsers, but 
have persistent cache for offline storage (which may be cleared often).

\subsection{Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Clients will mostly operate offline, with syncing times usually after working hours
    \item Server will be operating in a scalable and distributed architecture, initially using college or cloud infrastructure.
    \item Clients will operate offline-first using persistent browser cache to download and store filtered versions of the database on themselves, effectively reducing server load.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dependencies}

NodeJS, GraphQL, CouchDB, ReactJS

\section{Functional Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Connecting students and teachers through subscription portals (topics), which can be made private by virtue of an authentication code if needed.
    \item Allowing faculty and students to post content to specific groups, which are moderated by limited people.
    \item A real-time video conferencing platform using a Experimental lossy compression algorithm involving neural networks
\end{itemize}

\section{Non Functional Requirements}

\subsection{Scalability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scalable and simple since we are using GraphQL as our Web Services Framework and also using the ReactJS and CouchDB technology stack.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Portability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item React JS is cross platform. Graphgql is platform independent
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We will be using SSL for encrypting the traffic.
    \item Servers will have firewalls SSH connections protected by password and certificate.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Maintainability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We are using micro service architecture on the server side.
    \item On the client its reusable react components.
    \item We will  also be using third party npm packages.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We will be using distillation techniques for the neural networks and we will try to reduce the CPU and memory footprints as much as possible.
\end{itemize}

\section{Interface Requirements}

\subsection{User Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simple and minimal User Interface
    \item Responsive and easy to navigate User Interface
    \item User Interface elements must be consistent
    \item Strategic use of colors to suit the purpose
    \item Component to navigate to and display the content pertaining to video conferencing module
    \item Components to navigate to course subscription, profile and post, login, logout
    \item Components dealing with posting, collection and visual display of data analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SSH protocol for the server side interface
    \item Device hardware (eg; camera) use negotiation interface
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communication Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item WebRTC (Real-Time Communication) standards and protocols to enable real time, peer to peer audio and video communication
    \item Request/Response protocol, HTTP/1.1 (as inherent to GraphQL)
\end{itemize}

\section{Technology Used}
\textbf{Stack} :  Frontend - ReactJS (For Webapp), React Native (for Mobile App), 
Middleware - NodeJS, GraphQL
Backend - CouchDB, PouchDB databases 

\section{Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Web Service} - either: a service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the World Wide Web, or a server running on a computer device
    \item \textbf{Native App} - An app to be installed and run on a device
    \item \textbf{Neural Network Encoder} - A neural network encoder converts input into a feature vector which represents the input but taking less space then the original input
    \item \textbf{Reverse Proxy} - ensures smooth flow of traffic between the client and the server and routes the client requests to appropriate backend server
    \item \textbf{Load Balancing} - methodical and efficient distribution of network or application traffic across multiple servers
    \item \textbf{Persistent Cache} - intended for intermediate term storage of documents or data objects
    \item \textbf{Lossy Compression} - method of data compression in which the size of the file is reduced by eliminating data in the file
    \item \textbf{SSH} - Secure Shell Protocol is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another
    \item \textbf{WebRTC} - Web Real-Time Communication comprises of protocols, standards and JavaScript API which enable real time peer to peer communication
    \item \textbf{Peer to Peer} - Browser to Browser or an application to application communication over the internet
    \item \textbf{HTTP} - Hypertext Transfer Protocol gives users a way to interact with web resources such as HTML files by transmitting hypertext messages between clients and servers
