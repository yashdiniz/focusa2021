\section{Comparison between Key Technologies}

This section introduces key technologies, software packages and tools.
It is important to note that NVIDIA Maxine will not be used while building this project.
The subsection dedicated to NVIDIA Maxine contains a key observation which 
could possibly affect the project, hence it was added.
