\chapter*{ABSTRACT}

\emph{Colleges, schools and other educational environments have a lot of existing tools which help students and teachers interact and share resources. 
These tools, however, are developed to serve very specific and limited purposes and are very difficult to manage manually. 
Most of them fail to provide a single comprehensive platform for all necessary management operations. 
Moreover, these existing tools also fail to cater to the management and analysis of data and thus are not used for generating insights and management optimisation.}

\emph{This project aims to deliver a scalable web services framework which is easy to work with for both the developer and the end users. 
It will allow connecting students and teachers through subscription portals, by letting faculty moderators post content which can be accessed by the students and synced whenever an internet connection is available. 
Furthermore, the project will have a real-time video conferencing platform 
using an experimental lossy compression algorithm involving neural networks. 
Finally, various existing services like Google Calendar and Drive will be integrated, to ease 
automation efforts, reducing the need to manually manage multiple tools.}
